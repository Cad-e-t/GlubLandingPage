  <h1>Glubook Pre-Sale Pricing</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>By purchasing any Glubook pre-sale plan, you are securing lifetime access to Glubook Pro under the terms outlined below. These pre-sale offers are one-time payments that give you early access, monthly credits, and long-term benefits.</p>

  <h2>What You Get</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Lifetime access to Glubook Pro</li>
    <li>Monthly credit allocation based on your plan tier</li>
    <li>Founding user badge</li>
    <li>Access to private roadmap + feedback channels</li>
    <li>Early feature testing and direct influence on development</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Credit System</h2>
  <p>Glubook operates on a credit-based system to manage usage fairly and sustainably:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Credits reset monthly on your plan’s anniversary date</li>
    <li>Unused credits do not roll over</li>
    <li>Credits do not accumulate (no stacking)</li>
    <li>Example: If your plan includes 100 credits/month, your balance resets to 100 each month regardless of how many were used previously</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>One-Time Payment, No Recurring Charges</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You will only be charged once — no hidden fees, no renewals</li>
    <li>All Glubook Pre-Sale plans are final and non-refundable after 48 hours of purchase</li>
